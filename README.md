# Pitt-Project-1
This is the first program I wrote during my dual enrolment class while I was in my senior year of high school. We were instructed to write a program based off the currency used in Harry Potter and have a customer make some purchases and give them exact change. I did struggle with the loops in this program and it was the first higher level program I completed.
